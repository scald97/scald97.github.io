                <p>I am Serena Howard. As a person who likes to find answers and fix problems as well as take on challenges software development has 
                    always been something I found interesting but thought was too out of my league. However, after 10 years thiving but not feeling 
                    fulfilled in customer service I knew that I needed to do something I was more passionate about. I first started learning how to code 
                    taking a free course offered by Harvard as a CS50 class. It was just an introduction to the many languages used by developers and engineers
                    but I was hooked. After beginning my research on programs and with a few friends already working in the field I had a few suggestions
                     on how to further my education and learn to code I applied to We Can Code IT. Five months of hard work later I am only begginning this journey
                     but I am so excited to keep learning and growing adding to the number of women in tech!

                    <p>With this project I used Java with a focus on TDD and OOP to
                        create a game that allows the user to run a pet shelter. In this shelter, the user is allowed to
                        rescue pets while also having the option to have the pets adopted changing the number of pets
                        within the shelter. The application also allows the user to care for the pets such as feeding,
                        walking, and more.</p>

                    <p>This was a team project implementing TDD, MVC, and HTML to create a web-page for the user to use a research
                        about bird-watching opprotunities in different regions of Africa while also offering information on the different 
                        birds that can be found in that region and the best tools to do so.

                    <p>Our final project of the program was another team project in which we were able to use the different tools we had learned
                        to create a full stack web site. For this site we used Java in the backend to create MVC API's to call to the front end where 
                        we used JavaScript with REACT and CSS to create the functions of the site which act as a resource for people to educate themselves on 
                        social justice issues and activism. </p>
